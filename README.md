Hi! I'm Tiger

I grew up wanting to program things that moved... but then I discovered that often programming things that don't move can be even more challenging and just as interesting.

I work in software security at Silcon Labs. 

A EE by education, I'm currently working on expanding my CS capabilities into iOS and Web development. 

I'm passionate about finance, cooking, and using my abilities to make a positive impact in communities across the world.
