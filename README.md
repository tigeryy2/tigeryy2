Hi! I'm Tiger

I'm an engineer, artist, and photographer.

I grew up wanting to program things that moved... but then I discovered that often programming things that don't move can be even more challenging and just as interesting.

I work as a software engineer

I'm passionate about finance, cooking, and using my abilities to make a positive impact in communities across the world.
